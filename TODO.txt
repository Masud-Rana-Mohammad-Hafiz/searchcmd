TODO
====
* Support for more advanced prompt. Example: um@server#find . -name "*sh*"
* Many false positives. Example: "or space)"
* Should be possible to merge commands. All with same name and same flags
  should at least be related.
* Support for beautifulsoup in py3.

DONE
====
* cli (-v --verbose -e --engine --no-cache)
* Prettier output, color output?
* cli flags have been reversed
* cache does not work to load from
* Sometimes you do not want to split on '\n' ("search replace")
   Sometimes you do ("get process id", docker "remove stopped containers").
   In those two examples, the output of the command is included in a code-tag.
   tar "unpack", listing of examples in one code block. But that was in
   pre-tag, which should always be splitted by \n.
* Handle of when command starts with sudo
* Print download progress (one dot per downloaded search result?),
   x when error
* Implement download.get
* Support for using beautifulsoup if lxml fails
* cache (store in tmp), store as json? to_json/from_json for commands-
* Test example with unicode: date "set time", cyberciti.biz
* Split command on pipe (|). Example: Want xargs examples, but xargs is mostly
   invoked by piping other result to it: find ... | xargs ...
* Tests (py2 + py3)
* Package
